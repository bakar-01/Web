      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Tungwa Bakari, a Mathematics and Computer Science student with a
        strong interest in data science, software development, and emerging
        technologies. My academic background has equipped me with a solid
        foundation in analytical thinking, programming, and problem-solving,
        while my practical experience continues to refine my technical and
        professional skills.
        <br />
        Currently, I am undertaking my industrial attachment at Swahilipot Hub,
        where I am gaining hands-on experience in software development, data
        analysis, and community-driven technology projects. I have developed
        proficiency in Python, web development, and database management, and I
        am continuously expanding my expertise in full-stack development, UI/UX
        design, and data-driven solutions.
        <br />
        My professional goal is to leverage my skills to build scalable,
        user-centric applications and contribute to data-informed
        decision-making in organizations. I am particularly passionate about
        creating innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technology and
        real-world challenges.
        <br />
        I am a graduate from Meru University of Science and Techology. <br />I
        studied a bachelors degree in mathematics and computer science
        statistics option and graduated in the year 2025. <br />Currently I am a
        volunteer at Swahilipot hub Foundation where I help young individuals
        through mentoring and mastering basic and complex knowledge in
        technlogy. I am really looking forward into working with other companies
        where I could apply knowledge and skills to facilitate growth and
        prosperity.
